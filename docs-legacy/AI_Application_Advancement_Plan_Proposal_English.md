## Section 2: Project Content and Implementation Methods

### I. Project Origin and Industry Pain Points

#### Current Situation

Modern supply chain operations face increasingly complex challenges: globally distributed networks, real-time logistics demands, and dynamic environmental risks. Sensor networks and IoT systems generate massive amounts of data, but often lead to delayed alerts, redundant signals, and missed early warnings, directly impacting delivery reliability and financial efficiency.

According to the Gartner 2024 Supply Chain Research Report, 72% of enterprises face the dilemma of "information overload but insufficient insights," processing an average of 500+ alerts daily but with only 18% being critical events. Traditional rule engines cannot adapt to dynamic environmental changes, resulting in:
- False positive rate as high as 45%, exhausting analysts
- Critical risks discovered with an average delay of 4.2 hours
- Cross-border data governance costs increasing 23% annually

#### Demand Scenarios and Pain Points

**Pain Point 1: Alert Overload and Frequent False Positives**
- Phenomenon: IoT devices generate thousands of alerts daily, with 60% being non-critical or duplicates
- Impact: Analysts spend 70% of their time filtering invalid alerts, delaying critical risk response
- Need: Intelligent alert classification and priority ranking

**Pain Point 2: Inconsistent Multi-Sensor Data Quality**
- Phenomenon: Multi-source data from temperature, humidity, location sensors contains noise and drift
- Impact: Anomaly detection accuracy only 65%, false positive rate 38%
- Need: Signal processing and adaptive calibration

**Pain Point 3: Lack of Predictive Decision Support**
- Phenomenon: Senior management can only view historical reports, unable to quickly obtain risk insights
- Impact: Decision delays average 2.8 days, missing optimal response timing
- Need: Natural language queries and AI-driven recommendations

**Pain Point 4: Battery Life and Costs**
- Phenomenon: IoT devices use fixed sampling rates, leading to rapid battery depletion
- Impact: High annual battery replacement costs, heavy maintenance burden
- Need: AI-driven adaptive sampling optimization

| **4. IoT Edge AI Sampling** | • Fixed sampling rate depletes batteries quickly<br>• Battery life only 6 months<br>• High annual replacement costs | • RL-driven adaptive sampling<br>• Battery life extended to 10-14 months (+40-60%)<br>• Replacement costs reduced 70% |
| **5. Multi-Agent Collaboration** | • Single system cannot integrate multiple sources<br>• Manual coordination inefficient<br>• No cross-domain learning capability | • MCP-driven tool collaboration<br>• Automated task allocation and execution<br>• Federated learning protects privacy |
