# Team Shared Editing (Google Docs)

Purpose
- Use a single live Google Doc for parallel drafting and comments.
- Keep the repository as the source of record for submissions and versioned exports.

Master Doc (paste the live link here)
- URL: https://docs.google.com/document/d/REPLACE_WITH_DOC_ID/edit
- Quick open: double-click `Proposal-Shared-Doc.webloc` in this folder on macOS.

Create and share (owner or PM)
1) Create a new Google Doc named: `ItracXing MOEA Proposal (Live Draft)`.
2) Click Share → set one of:
   - Anyone with the link → Editor (for external reviewers), or
   - Restricted to your workspace domain with specific editors (preferred).
3) Copy the URL and replace it in this file and in `Proposal-Shared-Doc.webloc` (edit the URL string inside the file if needed).
4) Post the link in Slack and pin it. Also open an Issue: `Review section X`.

Working agreement
- Draft in Google Doc; keep tables/figures IDs aligned with the Markdown manuscript.
- Do not place financial details here. Budget lives under `../budget/` only.
- At milestones, export Google Doc to PDF and store under `../docs/reference-pdfs/` with date.
- Sync to Markdown: copy finalized sections into `AI應用躍昇計畫-計畫書-提交版.md` via PR.

Roles
- PM: owns sharing, access, and milestone exports.
- TL: reviews technical accuracy and consistency.
