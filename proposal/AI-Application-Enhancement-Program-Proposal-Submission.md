### **Phase II: AI Alert Optimization and Intelligent Sampling Integration (12 months) — Start Date: April 1, 2026**

**Note**: Phase II overlaps with Phase I for 2 months (April-May 2026) for data pipeline handoff and model training preparation, ensuring seamless transition. Actual execution period is M4-M15 (12 months total).

(1) Anomaly Alert and Route Detection Accuracy
Current anomaly detection primarily relies on rule-based threshold settings, unable to respond in real-time to road conditions, weather, and multinational logistics variables. The system struggles to distinguish "tolerable delays" from "potential fraud detours," causing high false alarm rates and frequent manual interventions. To improve accuracy and timeliness, this phase will introduce AI models for time-series analysis and alert optimization, reducing false alarms and improving alert response speed.

(2) Sensor Energy Consumption and Sampling Frequency Issues
Arviem IoT sensors are often limited by battery life and network bandwidth during long-haul transportation. Current fixed sampling intervals (every 10 minutes) cannot balance data integrity and energy efficiency, leading to data redundancy or premature battery depletion. This phase will develop an RL-based intelligent sampling strategy that automatically adjusts sampling frequency based on environmental changes, balancing power consumption and data quality.

---

### **Implementation Focus and Metrics**

1. **Objectives and Success Criteria**
     - Establish anomaly behavior prediction and alert models to improve alert accuracy and timeliness.

     - Deploy to Arviem experimental containers, complete field testing and joint validation.

2. **Data Acquisition and Integration**
     - Integrate IoT sensor GPS, temperature/humidity, vibration, voltage, RSSI, and other multi-dimensional data.
     - Combine external traffic and weather data to build training multi-dimensional time-series datasets.
     - Perform data cleansing, time-series synchronization, and anomaly sample annotation.

3. **AI Model Building and Training**
     - Apply LSTM/Transformer models to predict route anomalies and potential fraudulent behaviors.
     - Use DQN/SAC reinforcement learning algorithms to design intelligent sampling strategies.
     - Monitor model convergence and performance, ensuring stable operation under multiple routes and environmental conditions.

4. **Model Optimization and Testing**
     - Compare baseline rule engine with AI model performance through simulation and field testing.
     - Validate primary KPIs: F1 ≥0.85, false alarm rate ≤15%, data loss rate <5%.

### **Phase III: Multi-Agent Deployment and International Demonstration (6 months) — Start Date: January 1, 2027**

**Note**: Phase III actual execution period is M13–M18 (January 2027–June 2027); total project duration is 18 months (January 1, 2026 - June 30, 2027).

(1) Multi-Agent Collaboration and Monitoring Architecture
To address dynamic changes across sensor nodes, different routes, and cargo environmental conditions, a Multi-Agent collaborative platform is needed. Each agent is responsible for different tasks such as anomaly detection, environmental prediction, sampling decisions, and data integration. This platform can dynamically allocate resources, balance energy consumption, exchange anomaly information in real-time, ensuring stability and reliability of cross-regional transportation.

(2) Federated Learning and Data Privacy
In response to strict data privacy requirements from the EU and international clients, **Federated Learning** architecture will be implemented, allowing Arviem sensors and customer nodes to conduct collaborative model training without sharing raw data. This mechanism balances AI accuracy with data sovereignty and supports cross-border regulatory compliance.

(3) Actual Deployment and Demonstration
This phase will integrate Phase II outcomes (anomaly alerts and intelligent sampling models), complete cloud-edge collaborative operating architecture, and deploy to Arviem international containers and IoT nodes. Simultaneously conduct international demonstrations and marketing promotion, participate in international transportation and logistics forums, showcasing Taiwan's AI technology leadership in supply chain data intelligence applications.

### Phased Fund Disbursement and Critical Decision Points (Milestone Governance)

To ensure execution quality and controllable outcomes, adopt a phased disbursement mechanism, and set a Go/No-Go decision point at the end of Phase II.

#### Fund Disbursement Schedule

| Phase        | Period | Key milestone                         | Disbursement ratio | Disbursement amount | Retention     |
| ------------ | ------ | ------------------------------------- | ------------------: | ------------------: | ------------- |
| Phase I      | M1–M5  | NLQ (Natural Language Query) + anomaly detection + Kalman denoising | 40%                | 3,600K              | —             |
| Phase II     | M4–M15 | RL alerts + sampling optimization + validation | 35%                | 3,150K              | —             |
| Phase III    | M13–M18| Multi-agent + production deployment   | 20%                | 1,800K              | 5% (450K)*    |
| Final acceptance | M18+ | Pass acceptance tests               | 5%                 | 450K                | —             |
| Total        | —      | —                                     | 100%               | 9,000K              | —             |

*The final 5% retention will be released upon passing acceptance tests, patent filing submission, and delivery of technical documentation.

#### Critical Decision Point: M6 Go/No-Go Review

At the end of Phase I (June 2026), conduct a major review. At least 3 out of 4 KPIs must be achieved to proceed to Phase II/III:

| Indicator                  | Target | Minimum pass standard | Validation method                     |
| -------------------------- | ------ | --------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| 1. Anomaly detection accuracy | ≥90%  | ≥85%                  | Test set validation report (ITRI)     |
| 2. Kalman denoising SNR improvement | ≥20% | ≥15%               | Comparative analysis on real data     |
| 3. Arviem deployment site agreement | Signed | LOI confirmation | Cooperation agreement or Letter of Intent (LOI) |
| 4. Patent filing progress  | 1 filed | 1 in preparation      | Filing documents or drafts            |

Decision Criteria:
- Pass (GO): Achieve 3/4 KPIs → proceed with Phase II/III; disburse as planned
- Conditional pass: Achieve 2/4 KPIs → submit an improvement plan; retain 10% of Phase II budget; re-review at M9
- Suspend (NO-GO): Achieve fewer than 2 KPIs → terminate or significantly adjust scope; do not disburse Phase III budget

#### Risk Control Mechanisms

1. Monthly progress reports: submit progress summary and financial usage each month
2. Quarterly technical reviews: ITRI and external experts conduct technical reviews each quarter
3. Flexible budget adjustments: contingency reserve 600K can be reallocated upon approval
4. Personnel risk backup: if key staff change, submit a replacement plan within 30 days

This mechanism ensures efficient use of government subsidies and enables early detection and adjustment to safeguard project quality.

### International Market Potential and Output Value Estimation (supplement)

Assumptions
- Customer base: Arviem existing multinational enterprise customers > 5,000
- Penetration: 1% adoption in the first 3 years (≈ 50 companies)
- Average subscription: USD 12K/year/customer (1 USD ≈ NT$32)
- Exchange rate assumption: 1 USD = NT$32 (conservative)

Annual service revenue (AI-MaaS)
- Customers × annual subscription × FX ≈ 50 × 12,000 × 32 = NT$19.2M/year
- Three-year cumulative (no growth compounding; conservative) ≈ NT$57.6M

AI-RAN/O-RAN extended applications (co-development driven)
- Domestic AI-RAN industry annual output value: about NT$30M per year
- Overseas export (AI-RAN integrated projects and services): three-year cumulative about NT$90M

Overall output estimation (including multiplier effect)
- Output estimation formula:

$$
     ext{預估產值 (NT$)} = (\text{客戶數} \times \text{年訂閱價}) \times 32 \times 3\text{年} \times 1.3
$$

- Three-year cumulative overall output (AI-MaaS + AI-RAN driven, including upstream/midstream/downstream): about NT$120M
- Export ratio: about 70%; domestic contribution: about 30%

Notes
- KPI alignment: supports quantification for “industrial value and export potential” (MOEA review metrics)
- Conservatism: does not include scenarios with >1% penetration or ARPU uplift (sensitivity analysis available upon review)

### Core Data Points:

1. IoT device sales volume grows from 75 sets in 2026 to 1,200 sets in 2029, at $1,000 average price.
2. Service revenue (subscription or similar) grows steadily; customers increase from 2 (2027) to 4 (2029), with gradual ARPU uplift.
3. Forecast is a cautious scenario, reflecting strong confidence in market response and customer adoption.

## (III) Revenue Structure: Hardware vs. Services (2026–2029)

| Item           | 2026 (USD) | 2027 (USD) | 2028 (USD) | 2029 (USD) |
| -------------- | ----------: | ----------:| ----------:| ----------:|
| Total revenue  | $93,000     | $812,000   | $1,342,000 | $1,760,000 |
| Hardware (a)   | $75,000     | $600,000   | $900,000   | $1,200,000 |
| Services (b+c) | $18,000     | $152,000   | $242,000   | $360,000   |
| Hardware share | 80.65%      | 79.79%     | 78.81%     | 76.92%     |
| Service share  | 19.35%      | 20.21%     | 21.19%     | 23.08%     |

### Core Operations Notes and Analysis:

1. Hardware-led revenue: throughout 2026–2029, IoT hardware dominates, near 80% annually. Early-stage model relies on one-time hardware sales. ItracXing’s revenue risk correlates with Arviem channel execution and market acceptance of the $1,000/set pricing (and competitive pricing pressure).
2. Rising importance of services: though smaller in share, services (b+c) steadily increase (19.35% → 23.08%), aligning with the strategy to diversify revenue (consulting, tech licensing). Given higher margins, services may contribute disproportionately to profit and valuation.
3. Growth drivers:
     - 2026–2027: explosive growth ($93K → $752K) mainly from device volume (75 → 600 sets).
     - Post-2027: steady overall growth with rising services share, shifting towards a “hardware + services” solution model.

## Cooperation Model and Profit Sharing

### 1. Profit sharing for devices and services:

1) Via Arviem channel: 50% of profit to Arviem, 50% to ItracXing;
2) ItracXing direct sales: 100% of profit to ItracXing;
3) Technology licensing negotiated (patent royalties).

### 2. Role division:

- ItracXing designs and manufactures IoT tracking devices and IoT gateways based on Nordic NTN chips, selling to Arviem AG and through Arviem globally.
- Arviem serves as global sales/channel partner, promoting ItracXing-branded or co-branded IoT devices.

### Profit Sharing Mechanism:

```
                                        Sales Channels
                                     /              \
                                    /                \
                         Arviem Channel     Direct Sales
                                    |                 |
                                    |                 |
                            50/50 profit       100% to ItracXing
```
