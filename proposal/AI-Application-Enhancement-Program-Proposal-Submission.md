### Project Abstract (≤200 words)

Industry Mapping: Eight Major Industries Category 7 (Electronics assembly extension: smart manufacturing / logistics transportation).

Global demand for smart logistics visibility and traceability is accelerating. By 2030 the transport and logistics market is projected to reach NT$250.2 trillion. This project, jointly advanced by ItracXing and Switzerland-based Arviem, targets four core pain points: insufficient sensor reliability, time‑consuming report generation, delayed detection of environmental risks for temperature/humidity sensitive goods, and inability to promptly identify route diversion or suspected theft. We will build four AI modules: Battery Health Index / Remaining Useful Life (BHI/RUL), Natural Language Query (NLQ) + AI autonomous reporting, environmental anomaly detection, and route / theft detection. Within 18 months we will complete verification in ≥1 international + ≥1 domestic deployment site (International: Arviem; Domestic: Simique (TBD)) achieving sensor availability ≥95%, risk response time reduction ≥40%, temperature/humidity violation rate reduction ≥30%, and theft / unauthorized opening detection F1-score ≥0.85. We will establish an exportable AI-MaaS business model with projected cumulative three-year post‑completion output of NT$120M, elevating Taiwan’s international visibility in AI smart logistics.

This NT$120M three-year output is grounded in a concrete Smart TOTE business model: a per‑shipment AI monitoring fee of USD 2 / TOTE / shipment (marginal cost <1% of asset or cargo value) materially reduces environmental violation and theft risk. With 1,000 Smart TOTE units × 50 trips/year × 3 years, AI monitoring subscription revenue reaches ≈USD 300K (≈NT$9.6M). Combined with IoT device sales plus consulting/licensing, it forms the basis of the projected NT$120M (≈70% export revenue) outcome.

### Expected Benefits at Project Completion (Summary Table)
**Expected Benefits at Completion (Quantitative KPI Sources and Estimation Models)**

Below we explain each target’s source, assumptions, formulas, and validation approach to avoid listing goals without rationale. All KPIs align with later KPI / milestone sections.

#### 1. Overall Logic for KPI Formation
1. Baseline extraction (2024–2025 internal + Arviem deployment site historical data): sensor operational days, offline events, temperature/humidity violation records, GPS trajectories, manual reporting labor hours, anomaly response times.
2. Establish baseline → map to improvement mechanisms (model or process) → estimate improvement magnitude (literature ranges + internal prototypes) → set “conservatively achievable” targets.
3. Improvement magnitudes reference:
  - Internal small-scale prototype / PoC tests  
  - Public research / industry reports (range only, no verbatim citation)  
  - Typical automation labor reduction ranges (≈40–70%)

#### 3. Core Model / Estimation Brief
- BHI/RUL: Time-series deep learning (LSTM / Temporal Fusion Transformer (TFT)) + Kalman denoising + survival analysis (Cox / Kaplan-Meier).  
- Anomaly detection: statistical thresholds + change-point (CUSUM / Bayesian Online Change Point Detection (BOCPD)) + event alignment.  
- Route / ETA: GPS time-series encoding + graph road network (Graph Neural Network) + weather / traffic context; ETA error improvement → dispatch optimization → invalid mileage reduction.  
- NLQ: domain ontology + NL-to-SQL templated constraints + clarification turns + refusal strategy to reduce hallucination.  
- Revenue / output: bottom-up (customer count × Average Selling Price (ASP) × device count) and top-down (channel penetration) cross-validation.  
- ESG: route optimization + predictive maintenance (avoid offline retransmission) → invalid transport reduction; public emission factor for CO₂.

#### 4. Validation & Audit Mechanisms
- Quarterly model performance reports (BHI/RUL, environmental anomalies, route).  
- Event & mileage logs with retention (raw + action trail).  
- NLQ audit: semantic parse, SQL, result snapshot retained ≥12 months.

### 3. Competitive Landscape & Technical Advantage Analysis

#### (1) International Competitor Comparison

| Category | Typical Player Positioning | Key Strengths | Current Gaps | This Project Advantage |
|----------|---------------------------|---------------|--------------|------------------------|
| International digital forwarder / visibility platforms | Integrate booking, customs, tracking | Mature platforms, large customer base | Limited integration of IoT sensor data and AI predictive insight; NLQ mostly static queries | Focused “smart container + sensors” BHI/RUL, environmental pre-warning, route anomaly detection; NLQ direct querying of anomalies & supply chain risks |
| Sensor / device vendors | Provide temperature / vibration / location sensors + platform | Hardware variety, deployment experience | Predominantly rule-based alerts; lack of explainable AI and cross-container / lane learning | Kalman + deep time-series models produce explainable BHI/RUL & violation risk forecasts with auditable transparency |
| Cloud data & BI platforms | Data warehousing, dashboards | General-purpose, scalable | Heavy customization required for logistics IoT schemas & SOP | Logistics IoT semantic layer + NL-to-SQL; embeds container, lane, voyage vocabulary reducing customization burden |

#### (2) Technical Innovation & Differentiated Advantages

1. **Sensor Reliability & BHI/RUL: shift from “reactive alerts” to “predictive health management.”**  
  - Kalman filtering + deep time-series (LSTM/TFT) produce BHI and RUL, forecasting “when failure may occur,” not only signaling “already failed.”  
  - Incorporates temperature, usage patterns, transmission frequency to reduce false positives and extend service life.

2. **NLQ + Semantic Layer: shift from “reading static reports” to “ask and receive answers.”**  
  - Logistics domain ontology (Shipment, Lane, Container, Event, etc.) with NL-to-SQL ensures controlled, safe queries.  
  - Aggregates BHI, violation events, route anomalies, SLA KPIs—executives ask “What is this quarter’s Europe lane humidity violation trend?” instead of manual extraction.  
  - Tool constraints + refusal strategy: prevents hallucination and unauthorized retrieval—balancing usability and governance.

3. **Environmental & Route Anomaly: layered introduction minimizes false positives.**  
  - For temperature/humidity sensitive goods: “change-point + threshold + event alignment” MVP triggers AI autonomous event reports with P95 SLA ≤2 minutes and pre-warning rate targets.  
  - Route anomaly couples GPS, dwell pattern, weather / traffic context to distinguish “reasonable delay” vs. “high-risk diversion / theft,” prioritizing actionable alerts.

4. **Taiwan-first AI Logistics MaaS Architecture: replicable, verifiable, scalable.**  
  - Modular “AI function XaaS” (BHI/RUL, environmental pre-warning, route anomaly, NLQ reporting) enabling phased adoption by domestic SMEs (freight forwarders, warehousing, sensitive goods, security).  
  - Complete audit trails for models and decisions support GDPR / global compliance—emphasis on explainable, traceable AI governance.

---

#### (3) Market Entry & Taiwan Deployment Strategy

1. **Leverage existing international projects, feedback into Taiwan sites**  
  - Use current international customer deployment for initial data & model verification, accelerating accuracy and case evidence.  
  - Parallel small-scale Taiwan pilot (1–2 local forwarders / warehousing firms, tens of smart containers / totes).

2. **Focus on “high-value, high-risk goods” niches**  
  - Prioritize coffee beans, food ingredients, precision electronics—most sensitive to temperature/humidity, maximizing value demonstration.  
  - Reduced spoilage & claims + improved ETA & risk pre-warning generate quantifiable ROI (cost savings + premium service).

3. **Platform + licensing dual-track**  
  - Short term: LaaS / MaaS subscription (per device / container / query volume), reducing adoption friction.  
  - Mid/long term: model licensing / white-label for Taiwan system integrators or telecom operators embedding into 5G / AI solutions.

4. **International collaboration aligned with Taiwan value creation**  
  - Joint publications (academic / industry) with international partners (European logistics, universities) to amplify Taiwan’s AI + logistics profile.  
  - Core model & platform development anchored in Taiwan; local operational and maintenance talent retained.

## II. Project Content & Implementation Methods

【Summary】This section maps industry pain points to AI solutions and work packages (A–D), aligning “Pain Point → Solution → Milestone → KPI,” reinforcing data governance and security for measurable, traceable outcomes.

### 1. Project Origin & Industry Pain Points

The project targets four critical pain points driving “operational reliability, decision efficiency, customer experience” in smart logistics, each addressed by Work Packages A–D:

### **Pain Point 1 | Insufficient sensor reliability (battery degradation, environmental interference, data interruption)**

Sensors typically push data at fixed intervals lacking battery health or remaining life prediction. Offline events from voltage decay, signal attenuation, or interference surface only after data gaps occur—creating blind spots and raising maintenance cost.  
→ **Need:** Introduce Battery Health (BHI) and Remaining Useful Life (RUL) prediction for proactive maintenance, feeding Work Package B’s AI autonomous event reporting to lift system availability (Work Package A).

### **Pain Point 2 | Time-consuming report generation and lack of interactive access (manual consolidation, delayed decisions)**

Current report workflows manually stitch sensor time-series, GPS trajectories, door events, environmental records via spreadsheets or presentation decks, consuming hours to days. Semantic misalignment and version drift slow decisions. Executives cannot query insights directly via natural language, creating information latency.  
→ **Need:** Deploy AI autonomous reporting + Natural Language Query (NLQ) platform to enable automated data synthesis, rapid insight presentation, and interactive querying (Work Package B).

### **Pain Point 3 | Environmental risks for sensitive goods not preemptively surfaced (humidity fluctuations, insufficient root cause tracing)**

For humidity-sensitive goods (coffee beans, food ingredients, precision components), prolonged elevated humidity or abrupt oscillations cause spoilage, quality degradation, scrapping, and disputes. Existing systems focus on retrospective humidity curves without early alerts, causal context, or concise actionable summaries—hindering timely intervention.  
→ **Need:** Implement temperature/humidity anomaly detection + AI autonomous alert pipeline, integrating event reporting to compress detection → interpretation → action cycle (Work Package C).

### **Pain Point 4 | Route diversion & suspected theft not promptly identified (GPS deviation, manual interpretation)**

Monitoring relies on retrospective GPS review. Distinguishing “weather/traffic justified diversion” from “suspicious reroute or dwell” is difficult. Unauthorized container/tote opening often discovered only upon arrival, losing intervention window.  
Scenario: Semiconductor shipment (e.g., New Taipei/Hsinchu to Eindhoven). Typical path: Hsinchu factory → Port of Taipei (truck ~2 days) → port dwell (~1 day) → Rotterdam (ocean ~10 days) → port dwell (~2 days) → Eindhoven (truck ~2 days). Current system flags “truck >2 days not at port” as overdue—reactive. With pre-departure weather/traffic predictive signals, stakeholders receive proactive delay advisories. Route models learning normal sequences enable early warnings for abnormal diversion or high-risk zone dwell, plus padlock / pressure sensor triggers for unauthorized opening.  
→ **Need:** Build route anomaly & theft detection integrating GPS/NTN trajectories, geofence logic, pressure / lock states, external weather/traffic, reducing false alarms and pinpointing high-risk events, feeding AI reporting for investigation efficiency (Work Package D).

The project systematically maps these four pain points to Work Packages A–D with measurable KPIs to elevate reliability, safety, and international competitiveness.

### 2. AI Adoption Plan

【Explanation】This section links four pain points to Work Packages A–D AI technologies, plus data/model flow: A outputs BHI/RUL & sensor trust scores → consumed by B for query/report metrics; C/D anomaly events → trigger B’s AI reporting pipeline.

To balance innovation and feasibility, multi-agent (MA) collaboration and federated learning (FL) are layered into “mandatory MVP” vs. “exploratory PoC.” MVP emphasizes single-agent core functions (sensor health BHI/RUL, environmental & route anomaly detection, NLQ + AI autonomous reporting) validated in one international and one Taiwan deployment site with F1/AUC/MAE/latency/labor reduction KPIs, forming acceptance criteria. Multi-agent scheduling, coordinated risk scoring, cross-site FL aggregation remain exploratory prototypes not required for acceptance. This structure delivers commercial value within 18 months while preserving forward-looking R&D flexibility.

Sensor Reliability Optimization** | Battery State of Health (SoH) / BHI prediction, Remaining Useful Life (RUL), predictive maintenance models | Build BHI/RUL for proactive maintenance; raise sensor availability **90% → ≥95%** and enable intelligent maintenance scheduling. |
| **Pain Point 2 | Slow, non-interactive reporting (manual consolidation, decision lag)** | **B. AI Autonomous Reporting & NLQ** | Natural Language Query (NLQ), NL-to-SQL, Large Language Model (LLM) report composition | Enable executive & operations natural language access; shift reporting from “manual hours → automated seconds”; NLQ P95 latency <60 sec, query accuracy ≥90%. |
| **Pain Point 3 | Sensitive goods environmental risk not timely detected (humidity variation)** | **C. Sensitive Goods Environmental Anomaly Detection & AI Autonomous Event Reporting** | Change-point / statistical threshold anomaly detection, multivariate time-series models, event alignment (door / route segment) | Use temperature/humidity (T/H) & door events to detect sustained excursions / rapid spikes; auto-trigger event reporting. Targets: pre-warning rate ≥70%, violation rate reduction ≥30%, event report SLA (P95) ≤2 min. |
| **Pain Point 4 | Route diversion & suspected theft not promptly identified (GPS, manual)** | **D. Route Anomaly & Theft Detection (Smart TOTE)** | GPS/NTN spatiotemporal modeling, geofence behavioral analysis, lock/pressure anomaly detection, weather/traffic context modeling | Combine GPS/LTE/NTN + BLE padlock + pressure data + external context to classify reasonable delay vs. suspicious diversion / dwell / unauthorized opening. Targets: F1 ≥0.85, AUC ≥0.90, ETA MAE improvement ≥25%, false alert rate ≤15%, critical response time <30 min. |

| Final acceptance    | M18+    | Pass acceptance tests                                 | 5%                | 450K                | —          |
| Total               | —       | —                                                     | 100%               | 9,000K              | —          |

*The final 5% retention will be released after passing acceptance tests, submitting patent applications, and delivering technical documents.

#### Key Decision Point: M6 Go/No-Go Review (metrics mapped to Work Packages A/B/D)

At the M6 milestone (2026/06), conduct a major review. At least 3 of the 4 indicators below must be met to proceed:

| Indicator                     | Target    | Minimum pass | Verification method             |
| ---------------------------- | --------- | ------------ | -------------------------------- |
| 1. Anomaly detection accuracy | ≥ 90%     | ≥ 85%        | Test set validation report       |
| 2. Kalman denoising SNR uplift | ≥ 20%    | ≥ 15%        | Comparative analysis on live data |
| 3. Arviem deployment agreement | Signed    | LOI confirmed | Collaboration agreement or LOI   |
| 4. Patent application progress | 1 filed   | 1 in draft    | Application documents or draft   |

Decision criteria:

- GO: Meet 3/4 indicators → proceed with subsequent work packages; disburse per plan
- Conditional GO: Meet 2/4 indicators → submit improvement plan; hold back 10% of subsequent budget; re-review at M9
- NO-GO: Meet fewer than 2 indicators → terminate or materially adjust scope; withhold later budget

#### Risk Control Mechanisms

1. Monthly progress reports: summarize progress and financial usage
2. Quarterly technical reviews: external experts conduct technical reviews
3. Budget flexibility: the 600K contingency can be reallocated upon approval
4. Workforce backup: if key personnel change, submit replacement plan within 30 days

This mechanism ensures efficient use of public funds, early detection of issues, and timely adjustments to protect deliverable quality.

---

#### (3) Energy-Saving and Carbon-Reduction Benefits

> Explain how adaptive sampling, route optimization, and early anomaly warnings achieve energy saving and ESG benefits, with transparent assumptions and CO₂ estimation.

1. Reduce invalid transport and waste from environmental violations for temperature and humidity sensitive goods

- Through early warnings and AI autonomous event reports, expect ≥ 30% reduction in environmental violations, lowering scrap, returns, and re-shipments.  
- Assuming 1,000 high-value shipments per year with 5% requiring re-shipments due to environmental anomalies, a 30% violation reduction avoids ≈ 15–20 long-haul re-shipments annually.  
  - Under the Smart TOTE business model, the per-trip AI monitoring fee of USD 2 per TOTE per shipment is < 1% of cargo or container asset value; preventing a single re-shipment or scrap offsets dozens to hundreds of AI service trips, while reducing invalid transport and CO₂ emissions—aligning financial and ESG benefits.

2. Route optimization and reduced invalid mileage

- Route anomaly detection and ETA prediction optimization help eliminate unjustified detours and suspicious dwell, replacing inefficient routes with better dispatching.  
- The KPI “ESG: invalid transport reduction ≥ 10–12%” is computed by comparing mileage and fuel before vs. after optimization.

3. CO₂ reduction estimation (illustrative formula)

Let:

- \(D_{base}\): average annual mileage (km) before adoption  
- \(r\): invalid transport reduction rate (10% conservative)  
- \(EF_{CO₂}\): CO₂ emission factor per km (kg CO₂/km)

Then three-year cumulative CO₂ reduction is:

\[
\Delta CO₂ \approx D_{base} \times r \times EF_{CO₂} \times 3
\]

Using typical fleets for temperature and humidity sensitive goods and general trucks at ≈ 0.8–1.0 kg CO₂/km and annual mileage of 300,000–400,000 km, a 10% reduction over three years yields ≈ 80+ tons CO₂e, consistent with the summary table estimate of “10–15% reduction, ≈ 80+ tons CO₂e.”

4. Data and method transparency

- Energy-saving and carbon-reduction metrics will be based on actual mileage, fuel use, and anomaly event statistics, with assumptions and data sources disclosed in the final report.

---

#### (4) Commercialization Plan and Targets (within three years post-completion)

> Focus on specific three-year post-completion commercialization pathways, revenue composition, and targets, aligned with current technical and site validation outcomes.

1. Market positioning and addressable market (SAM → SOM)

- Target high-value cargo scenarios (electronic components, precision equipment, coffee beans) in cross-border and temperature and humidity sensitive logistics with an integrated “IoT devices + AI-MaaS subscription” solution.  
- With Arviem’s > 5,000 multinational customers as a base, assume a conservative 1% adoption in three years (≈ 50 customers), each with ≈ USD 12,000 annual subscription revenue, yielding ≈ NT$19.2M per year (≈ NT$57.6M over three years). Adding IoT device sales and consulting/licensing, cumulative output ≈ NT$120M with ≈ 70% export share.

2. Smart TOTE business model and revenue scenario (representative)

This project centers on Smart TOTE + AI monitoring service, combining IoT hardware and a cloud AI platform with subscription pricing. In this phase, the primary model is a per-shipment AI monitoring fee; monthly rental and advanced plans are expansion options.

- Per-shipment primary model: charge ≈ USD 2 / TOTE / shipment for each door-to-door trip, covering T/H and location data, environmental anomaly detection, route deviation/theft risk detection, and AI event reporting. This lowers adoption friction and suits pilots and frequent rotations.
- Value and price rationality: with a Smart TOTE asset value ≈ USD 200 and per-shipment cargo value typically in the hundreds of thousands of USD, USD 2 per trip is < 1% of cargo/container value; avoiding a single environmental scrap or theft can repay dozens to hundreds of AI service trips while reducing re-shipments and CO₂ emissions, meeting ESG and risk requirements.
- Extended monthly rental (noted option): for long-term customers, offer ≈ USD 8–12 / TOTE / month (including hardware amortization, connectivity, and full AI services), recouping ≈ 1.5–2x container asset value over three years as an upgrade path after per-shipment maturation.

Under “1,000 Smart TOTE × 50 trips/year × USD 2/trip”:

- Three-year trips ≈ 1,000 × 50 × 3 ≈ 150,000 trips;
- At USD 2/trip, three-year AI monitoring revenue ≈ USD 300,000 (≈ NT$9.6M at 1:32);
- If some customers switch to monthly rental in years 2–3 (USD 8–12/month/TOTE), AI subscription revenue further increases, forming stable ARR—an important component of the “NT$120M in three years” outcome; the remainder is IoT sales plus consulting/licensing, as detailed in “Revenue Forecast and Mix (2026–2029).”

4. Revenue mix and profit-sharing mechanism

- In the near term, hardware (IoT devices) contributes the majority of revenue; services (AI-MaaS/consulting/licensing) increase year over year, reaching ≈ 23% in 2029.  
- Channel profit-sharing with Arviem is 50:50; ItracXing direct sales are fully recognized by ItracXing; licensing is negotiated case by case.

5. Key commercialization targets within three years post-completion (KPIs)

- Cumulative paid or long-term trial (> 6 months) customers ≥ 10.  
- Deployed IoT devices (Smart TOTE/TC605 + LaaS) ≥ 1,000 units.  
- Three-year cumulative AI-MaaS/consulting/licensing revenue ≥ NT$80M, with ≈ 70% from international customers.

---
6. Explanation of the rationale for the three-year NT$120M output target

Combining the market analysis, Smart TOTE revenue model, KPIs, and international collaboration, the three-year NT$120M target is “conservatively achievable,” based on:

- Customer volume and conversion (via Arviem channel): Arviem serves > 5,000 international customers. If ≈ 1% (≈ 50) enter PoC/trials in three years and ≈ 20% (10) convert to paid or long-term, the KPI of “≥ 10 cumulative paid or long-term trial customers within three years” is met. This is a conservative penetration in SCM and smart logistics.  
- Device scale and Smart TOTE revenue scenario (aligned to 1,000 IoT devices KPI): With ≥ 1,000 deployed devices (Smart TOTE/TC605 + LaaS), the representative per-shipment scenario “1,000 Smart TOTE × 50 trips/year × USD 2/trip” yields ≈ USD 300,000 (≈ NT$9.6M) in three-year AI monitoring revenue—part of AI-MaaS subscription income. If some customers shift to monthly rental (USD 8–12/month/TOTE) in years 2–3, ARR increases. On hardware, at ≈ NT$10,000 average device price including activation, cumulative device revenue ≈ NT$10M, contributing to overall output.  
- AI‑MaaS/consulting/licensing revenue decomposition: For cross-border supply chains and temperature and humidity sensitive goods, NT$1–2M per customer per year for “AI-MaaS subscription, event analytics/reporting, system optimization consulting, and licensing” is reasonable. Using NT$1.5M/year mid-point, 10 customers over three years ≈ NT$45M. Combined with per-shipment/monthly Smart TOTE income, device refresh/expansion, project-based consulting, and white-label deals, and per the “Revenue Forecast and Mix (2026–2029)” table, three-year total ≈ NT$120M, with ≈ NT$80M from AI‑MaaS/consulting/licensing and ≈ NT$40M from IoT sales and refresh/expansion—aligned with the KPI “≥ NT$80M AI‑MaaS/consulting/licensing revenue.”  
- Cross-check with third-party market size: With SCM CAGR ≈ 8.7% (2025–2030), AI in Logistics CAGR ≈ 36.3%, and cold chain monitoring CAGR ≈ 12.6%, NT$120M over three years is a tiny fraction of the global smart logistics and cold chain markets, reflecting early adoption via the Arviem channel rather than overestimation. Against a combined 2028–2030 AI in Logistics + cold chain monitoring market of ≥ USD 5–6B (conservative), ≈ USD 3.7–3.8M (NT$120M) is on the order of one-thousandth.

Therefore, the NT$120M target is grounded in conservative customer counts (≥ 10), reasonable device scale (≈ 1,000), clear Smart TOTE pricing (USD 2/trip and USD 8–12/month), acceptable service ASPs, and third-party market growth, aligned with project KPIs (customers, device scale, international share), ensuring auditability and feasibility—and directly answering “how does this make money?” in reviews.

7. International tradeshow strategy (CES 2026 international showcase and pipeline development)

To support international validation and commercialization, the applicant plans a focused presence at CES 2026 (in planning), centered on AI‑MaaS + Smart TOTE NTN connectivity. CES serves as a showcase and pipeline development channel for project outcomes, not mere marketing of existing products, and will feature BHI/RUL, environmental anomaly detection, route/theft detection, and NLQ reporting.

- Showcase focus: a 3–5 minute scenario demo highlighting “improved sensor reliability, early environmental warnings, route/theft risk detection, and executive reporting,” emphasizing technical value and real scenarios. All content will be clearly marked as “prototype/demonstrator based on this project” to avoid confusion with mass products.  
- Collaboration: plan a joint booth or joint pitch with Arviem during CES, packaging “Taiwan-developed AI‑MaaS + Smart TOTE NTN connectivity” as an integrable solution for Arviem’s global customers—an international export demonstration of this project’s outcomes.  
- Target outcomes: collect feedback on pain-point priorities, adoption barriers, and pricing; aim for 3–5 LOIs/POC intents as a post-completion pipeline. Evidence includes intent letters and meeting minutes. These are commercialization plus items, not core technical milestones.

All CES 2026 and other tradeshow-related costs (booth, travel, materials) will be self-funded by the applicant and not drawn from government grants, ensuring grants prioritize AI model R&D, deployment site validation, and technical integration. If tradeshow plans change, the applicant will use online demos, regional professional events, or Arviem co-hosted briefings to achieve equivalent pipeline goals without impacting technical and validation milestones.

#### (5) Outreach and Dissemination Plan

> Describe how to amplify demonstration effects through outreach and knowledge sharing after achieving technical and commercial outcomes, supporting diffusion and export.

1. Technical publications and professional communities

- Iterative optimization: propose next-period improvement plans and required resources for underperforming KPIs.
- Audit and traceability: dashboard versions/query routing/model versions and outputs are retained for reproducible audits.

### Third-Party Data Supplement (Market Size and Growth)

- Global Supply Chain Management (SCM) market size and growth: the SCM solutions market is projected to grow from USD 38.51B in 2025 to USD 58.42B in 2030, a Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of about 8.7%, showing steady growth for “supply chain digitization and visibility solutions.” (Source: MarketsandMarkets, Supply Chain Management (SCM) Market, 2025)  
- AI in Supply Chain & Logistics market growth: applications of Artificial Intelligence in supply chain and logistics are growing rapidly, with the “AI in Supply Chain & Logistics” market projected to increase from USD 1.713B in 2023 to USD 3.377B in 2030, CAGR about 10.1%. (Source: Pyrops WMS compilation citing third-party market research)  
- High-growth submarket AI in Logistics: research focused on “AI in Logistics” indicates market size growth from USD 260M in 2022 to USD 4.346B in 2030, CAGR about 36.3%, showing smart logistics is a high-growth submarket that overlaps the project’s target customers. (Source: Research and Markets, AI in Logistics Market, 2023)  
- Cold chain monitoring market (temperature/humidity-sensitive goods scenarios): aligned with the project’s focus on temperature and humidity sensitive goods monitoring, the Cold Chain Monitoring market is projected to grow from USD 8.31B in 2025 to USD 15.04B in 2030, CAGR about 12.6%, one of the priority application domains for this project. (Source: MarketsandMarkets, Cold Chain Monitoring Market, 2025)  

These third-party studies show “supply chain digitization/smart logistics/cold chain monitoring” have clear, steady growth, while “AI in Logistics” is a high-growth submarket. This supports the project’s focus on AI modules (BHI/RUL, anomaly detection, route/theft detection, NLQ reporting) and temperature/humidity-sensitive goods scenarios, indicating sufficient international market space and commercialization potential.

Combined with observations from Arviem’s existing customer base, among Arviem’s 5,000+ international customers, about 20–30% are in high-value manufacturing (electronics assembly, precision equipment) and temperature/humidity-sensitive goods (food, agriculture), which highly overlap the project’s priority application scenarios. If only 1–2% of these customers enter PoC/adoption within three years, it is sufficient to support the targets of “≥ 10 customers, ≥ 1,000 IoT devices” and “three-year NT$120M output,” indicating the project’s assumptions are conservatively achievable and not based on overly optimistic market share.
