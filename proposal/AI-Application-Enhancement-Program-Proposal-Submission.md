### (2) Project Work Item Implementation Methods (Including Percentage/Unit)

### **Phase I: AI-Driven Interactive Real-time Reporting Service (Arviem Customers) (5 months)—Start Date: 2026/01/01**

(1) Battery Life and Sensor Reliability
Arviem sensors integrate multiple environmental measurement functions with current reliability around 90%, but main failure causes are battery depletion and temperature variations. Battery discharge curves are unstable, high temperatures accelerate degradation, and there is a lack of unified **Battery Health Index (BHI)** and lifespan warning mechanisms, preventing maintenance units from predicting or planning replacements in advance.

(2) Customer Reporting and Data Query Efficiency
Currently, weekly/monthly reports are mostly manually compiled, time-consuming and lacking interactivity. Customers cannot query cargo status and battery status in real-time, nor is there capability to automatically generate executive management reports, causing decision delays and information opacity.

### **Implementation Focus and Metrics**

1. **Goals and Success Criteria**
    - Establish multi-source battery monitoring database covering ≥95% sensor upload data.
    - Provide real-time visualization interface and query services
    - Establish battery lifespan key performance indicators (KPI) (Battery Health Index, BHI), covering temperature, capacity, and voltage variations.
    - Weekly/monthly reports automatically generated, reducing manual report preparation time by ≥50%.

2. **Data Acquisition and Integration**
    - Integrate battery voltage (V), remaining capacity (%), temperature (°C), and other data.
    - Introduce preliminary cleaning and smoothing mechanisms (such as moving average and Kalman filter).
    - Generate daily battery capacity change rate (ΔCapacity/Δt), average voltage curves, and temperature distributions.

3. **Real-time Monitoring and Visualization System Development**
    - Establish battery lifespan real-time monitoring dashboard displaying remaining lifespan estimates and anomaly indicators for each sensor.
    - Provide natural language query interface (e.g., "Which sensors have battery life below 30% this week?").
    - Features include battery voltage-temperature interaction charts, lifespan degradation curves, transmission frequency distributions, and other analytical functions.

4. **Automated Reporting and Alert Mechanisms**
    - Automatically generate executive weekly/monthly reports through system database integration and metric calculation mechanisms.
    - Support email notifications or dashboard push through MCP and database scheduling integration.
    - Added "Executive Priority Alert Report": For major anomalies, SLA risks, and operational impacts, automatically compile Top N events, root cause summaries, recommended actions, and responsible units daily/weekly, providing email and dashboard-specific real-time push.

5. **Testing and Demonstration**
    - Test data integrity rate, query latency, BHI update frequency.
    - Demonstrate "Battery Life Real-time Dashboard" and automated report generation process.

### **Phase II: AI Alert Optimization and Intelligent Sampling Integration (12 months)—Start Date: 2026/04/01**

**Note**: Phase II overlaps with Phase I for 2 months (2026/04-05) for data pipeline handover and model training preparation, ensuring seamless transition. Actual execution period is M4-M15 (total 12 months).

(1) Anomaly Alert and Route Detection Accuracy
Current anomaly detection mainly relies on rule-based threshold settings, unable to respond in real-time to road conditions, weather, and multinational logistics variables. The system struggles to distinguish between "tolerable delays" and "potential fraud detours", causing high false positive rates and frequent manual interventions. To improve accuracy and timeliness, this phase will introduce AI models for time-series analysis and alert optimization, reducing false positives and improving alert response speed.

(2) Sensor Energy Consumption and Sampling Frequency Issues
Arviem IoT sensors are often limited by battery life and network bandwidth during long-distance transportation. Current fixed sampling intervals (every 10 minutes) cannot balance data integrity and energy efficiency, leading to data redundancy or premature battery depletion. This phase will develop intelligent sampling strategies centered on reinforcement learning (RL), automatically adjusting sampling frequencies based on environmental changes to balance power consumption and data quality.

---

### **Implementation Focus and Metrics**

1. **Goals and Success Criteria**
    - Establish anomaly behavior prediction and alert models to improve alert accuracy and timeliness.

    - Perform data cleaning, time-series synchronization, and anomaly sample annotation.

3. **AI Model Construction and Training**
    - Apply LSTM/Transformer models to predict route anomalies and potential fraud behavior.
    - Use DQN/SAC reinforcement learning algorithms to design intelligent sampling strategies.
    - Monitor model convergence and performance to ensure stable operation under multiple routes and environmental conditions.

4. **Model Optimization and Testing**
    - Compare baseline rule engine and AI model performance through simulation and actual testing.
    - Verify main KPIs: F1 ≥0.85, false positive rate ≤15%, data loss rate <5%.
    - Evaluate battery life extension rate and data quality improvement, complete performance verification report.

5. **Deployment and Demonstration**

    - Demonstrate "Anomaly Event Prediction Dashboard" and "Adaptive Sampling Life Prediction System".
    - Complete joint testing and ITRI technical verification report as basis for Phase III multi-agent integration.

---

### **Expected Results and Impact**

This phase will establish a closed-loop AI system from anomaly detection to sampling decisions. Through intelligent alerts and energy optimization, it will effectively improve overall transportation monitoring efficiency and operational sustainability. Upon completion, Arviem customers can monitor cargo in real-time, reduce fraud risks, extend sensor lifespan, and reduce operational costs.

- B2 IoT Intelligent Sampling Strategy Optimization and Deployment (19%) – ItracXing Corporation (M4-M11)
- B3 Joint Verification and Testing (5%) – ITRI + Research Centers (M13-M15)

### **Phase III: Multi-Agent Deployment and International Demonstration (6 months)—Start Date: 2027/01/01**

**Note**: Phase III actual execution period is M13–M18 (2027/01–2027/06). Total project period is 18 months (2026/01/01 - 2027/06/30).

(1) Multi-Agent Collaboration and Monitoring Architecture
To respond to dynamic changes across sensor nodes, different routes, and cargo environmental conditions, a multi-agent collaborative platform is needed. Each agent is responsible for different tasks such as anomaly detection, environmental prediction, sampling decisions, and data integration. This platform can dynamically allocate resources, balance energy consumption, exchange anomaly information in real-time, and ensure stability and reliability of cross-regional transportation.

(2) Federated Learning and Data Privacy
To meet the strict data privacy requirements of the EU and international customers, **Federated Learning (FL)** architecture will be introduced, allowing each Arviem sensor and customer node to perform collaborative model training without sharing raw data. This mechanism can balance AI accuracy and data sovereignty while supporting cross-border regulatory compliance.

(3) Actual Deployment and Demonstration
This phase will integrate Phase II achievements (anomaly alerts and intelligent sampling models), complete cloud-edge collaborative operation architecture, and actually deploy on Arviem international containers and IoT nodes. Simultaneously conduct international demonstrations and marketing promotions, participate in international transportation and logistics forums, and showcase Taiwan's AI technology's leading applications in supply chain data intelligence.

### **Expected Results and Impact**

Upon Phase III completion, the system will have "distributed collaboration, privacy protection, real-time early warning" AI supply chain monitoring capabilities.

   - Reduce Phase II model iteration risks (RL and noise reduction algorithms can rapidly iterate on stable data interfaces).
   - Shorten overall time-to-market (Phase III focuses on multi-agent collaboration and productization, no longer constrained by data access timelines).
