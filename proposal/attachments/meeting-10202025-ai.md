# ðŸ§  AI Project Funding Proposal Meeting Summary (18-Month Pilot Plan)

## 1. Proposal Overview
- A draft for a government-funded AI project was developed using AI tools to accelerate preparation amid limited internal resources.
- The project is structured as an **18-month AI pilot** (rather than the full 2-year option) to ensure focused delivery and measurable results.
- The total funding request is approximately **US $800 K (â‰ˆ NT $25 M)**.
- Financial planning and personnel allocations will be refined internally, ensuring realistic cost distribution and role alignment across technical, research, and management functions.

## 2. Proposal Strategy
- **Demonstrated AI and ML expertise** with industrial applications and prior R&D success.
- **Compliance** with government subsidy criteria (innovation, company maturity, sector alignment).
- A **phased roadmap** that showcases stepwise value creation and quantifiable progress.

**Technical focus areas:**
- Battery anomaly detection and predictive reliability analysis
- Sensor performance optimization through hybrid AI + signal processing models
- The deliverables are aligned with the 18-month funding cycle, emphasizing tangible outcomes and export-readiness.

## 3. Phased AI Development Roadmap
### Phase 1 (4.5 months): Proof-of-Concept & Foundations
- Implement the first anomaly-detection prototype using historical battery/sensor data.
- Develop AI-driven dashboards for management visualization and anomaly insights.
- Deploy a natural-language query interface to allow human-in-the-loop analytics.


### Phase 2 (7.5 months): Reinforcement Learning & Language Integration
- Validate early metrics and collect data for reinforcement learning training.
- Integrate Reinforcement Learning (RL) for adaptive thresholding and decision optimization.
- Demonstrate incremental improvements in prediction accuracy and reliability performance.

### Phase 3 (6 months): Multi-Agent Orchestration & Export-Ready Pilot
- Extend the RL engine into a multi-agent orchestration system for collaborative anomaly reasoning.
- Perform system validation, field deployment, and explainability audits.
- Deliver an export-ready AI pilot integrating all modules for industrial and logistics partners.

## 4. AI Consortium Collaboration
- The project is part of a multi-party consortium combining industrial partners and academic researchers.
- Collaboration areas include algorithm design, dataset sharing, and benchmarking.
- The roadmap aligns with national goals for AI-driven manufacturing resilience and international R&D exchange.

## 5. Battery Anomaly Detection & Reliability Goals
- **Objective:** Achieve â‰¥ 30% improvement in battery and sensor reliability metrics.
- **Approach:** Combine statistical anomaly detection, RL-based adaptation, and explainable AI models.
- **KPIs:**
  - Reduction in false/missed detections
  - Improved uptime and mean-time-between-failure (MTBF)
  - Higher energy efficiency and reduced maintenance costs

## 6. Commercialization & Sustainability Strategy
- The team aims for both technological impact and economic sustainability through:
  - Government subsidy + profit-sharing mechanisms for balanced incentives
  - IP and data-ownership frameworks that protect contributors while enabling reuse
  - Licensing and export pathways for regional and global deployment
- Post-pilot, the project will serve as a foundation for commercialization in AI-enabled logistics, industrial monitoring, and semiconductor manufacturing contexts.
